                Aston Martin is a British car manufacturer that has participated in Formula One in various forms.
                The company first participated in Formula One during the 1959 season where they debuted the DBR4 chassis using their own engine but it failed to score any points.
                They continued to perform poorly through the 1960 season, once again failing to score any points. As a result, Aston Martin decided to leave Formula One after 1960.

                A commercial rebranding of the Racing Point F1 Team led to the team being rebranded as Aston Martin for 2021 which competes using Mercedes power units.
                The team is headed by Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer with Lance Stroll and Sebastian Vettel as their main drivers.
